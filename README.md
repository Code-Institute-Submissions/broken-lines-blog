# Broken Lines Blog

This project is to develop a small blog website for the band Broken Lines, as a micro service to enable bnd followerss to keep informed on what hte band is doing and comment and discuss relevant posts.

From a users perspective, they should be able to view posts made by the band, and, if a registered user, comment on those posts to enage in conversation with other users or the band themselves.

In terms of design, a minimalistic approach has been taken in order to let the vibrance of the blg post images dictate the overal feel of the site. should be a cohesive colour scheme and set of styles across the whole site to reiterate the artist's brand. Site layout should enhance rather than impede the user experience to give a welcoming, intuitive feel.

A responsive site layout enables easy navigation on all devices.

The completed sprint was composed of 15 separate items. Having used the MoSCoW approach to prioritisation, 9 were classified as "Must-Have" making up less than 60% of the tasks as recommended. The rest of the first sprint was made up of "Should-Have" and "Could-Have" items.
There were no remaining backlog items.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar**

Navigation is provided via a bootstrap navbar. CSS code has been added to underline menu items on hover and tint the navbar for each page. Font Awesome icons have been added to each menu item to add visual clues.

- **The Footer**

The page footer is arranged in 2 rows. The first row contains social media links for the site and the second row contains links to the site team's GitHub pages.
The footer layout was created using CSS flex.

### Home Page

The Home page is formed by a carousel built on Bootstrap as the main element, a gradient banner, and two Bootstrap grids, the first one with two images and two pieces of text and the second one with  four images on the same row. The first element, the carousel is built up to catch the users' attention when they first visit the site and inform them about the content to expect through the site. Following the carousel, a banner works as a transitional element between the carousel and the content. 

The gradient style of the banner uses the same colours as the images chosen for the first grid and its borders. Finally, the last point  is the use of representative images of the painter and her creative process taking place, in order to provide relevant visual information about the quality of the artistâ€™s work.

### About Page

The About page is compounded by two pictures, followed by two pieces of text. Bootstrap grid has been used to fit them on the page and make them responsive. For smaller devices, the elements collapse one on top of each other, having the images at the top and the bottom, and the text, in the center.  For devices with higher resolution such as tablets, laptops and desk computers, the elements expand evenly in two rows, and each element takes  50 per cent of the space available.

### Gallery Page

The gallery page contains eight four-piece collections from the artist, displayed in a grid using Bootstrap CSS. The user can click on any of the pieces to see it full-size, and an on-hover shadow effect highlights image as the mouse passes over them.

### Contact Page

The contact page is comprised of two parts. First, there is a contact form for users to get in touch with the artist. This give options to submit either a general enquiry, a purchase enquiry or to contact about a commission. 

The second part of the page deals with contact details for the artist giving a portrait photo, contact details and an embedded map showing her location.

This page was structured using bootstrap.
