The struggle is real: you're armed with console.log, but the bugs still seem to emerge victoriously, eluding your every attempt to exterminate them.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nThe Humble console.log\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nIn the world of debugging, console.log is the bread and butter of JavaScript developers. Need to know what's hiding in that object? Or why that function returns undefined? Just slap in a console.log, and you're good to go! Well, sort of. If only things were that easy.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nBrowser Dev Tools: Your Secret Weapon\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nBrowser development tools are like the Swiss Army knife of debugging. Chrome DevTools, Firefox Developer Edition, Safari Web Inspector—you name it, they've got it. With the power to inspect elements, trace network requests, and even simulate mobile devices, these tools turn you into a veritable Sherlock Holmes.</p><p><b>\r\n\r\nDebuggers and Breakpoints: Pause for a Cause</b></p><p>\r\n\r\nJavaScript has a built-in debugger statement that allows you to stop the code execution right where you think the culprit lies. Pausing the code helps you inspect variables, traverse the call stack, and essentially catch the bug red-handed. The trick is to know where to put the breakpoint; otherwise, you're just pausing for no reason.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nLinters and Error Trackers: Because Two Heads Are Better Than One\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nLinters like ESLint don’t just keep your code clean; they act as the first line of defense against syntactic and logical errors. If you’re working on a large-scale project, consider using error-tracking services like Sentry, which aggregate, filter, and prioritize errors for you.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nIn Conclusion: Debugging is an Art, Not Just a Chore\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nDebugging is an integral part of the development process, and mastering it is like gaining a superpower. It's the forensic science of the coding world, full of clues, suspects, and occasionally, red herrings. So the next time you find yourself down the debugging rabbit hole, remember: it's not just about finding what's broken; it's about understanding how things work—or why they don't.\r\n\r\nWith enough practice and patience, debugging will transform from a source of dread to a rewarding challenge. Because at the end of the day, there's nothing quite like the sweet victory of a bug-free script.</p>", "created_on": "2023-07-14T13:58:53.884Z", "status": 1, "excerpt": "From classic console.log statements to the nuances of browser dev tools, discover how to troubleshoot your JavaScript code without pulling your hair out.", "updated_on": "2023-09-13T09:43:19.754Z"}}, {"model": "blog.post", "pk": 6, "fields": {"title": "Django Unchained: Breaking Free from the Confines of Vanilla Web Development", "slug": "django-unchained-breaking-free-from-the-confines-of-vanilla-web-development", "author": 1, "featured_image": "image/upload/placeholder", "content": "<p>When you first step into the world of web development, everything looks so—how should I put it—vanilla. HTML, CSS, JavaScript. You become a jack of all trades but find that building anything more complex than a \"Contact Us\" page is akin to assembling a spaceship with a Swiss Army knife. That's when I discovered Django, the web framework for perfectionists with deadlines.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nThe Hero We Deserve\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nDjango is more than just a high-level Python web framework; it's like having a skilled co-pilot. It takes care of a lot of the groundwork, such as user authentication, database schemas, and admin panels, allowing you to focus on what truly matters—building your unique application. </p><p><b>ORM: Your New Best Friend\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nNo, ORM is not a character from Lord of the Rings. It stands for Object-Relational Mapping, and it's one of Django's killer features. Gone are the days when you have to write lengthy SQL queries; ORM does it for you. Now, even your database speaks Python!\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nDon’t Repeat Yourself (DRY)\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nI love this principle, and not just because it saves me time. DRY is a core philosophy of Django. Why write the same code twice when you can automate it? With reusable apps and components, Django makes sure your development process is as efficient as it gets.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nMiddleware Magic\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nMiddleware in Django is like the stage crew in a theater production. They're behind the scenes, making sure everything runs smoothly. Whether it’s handling sessions, authentication, or custom functions, middleware has got you covered.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nIn Conclusion: Django Does the Heavy Lifting\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nIf you’re looking to break free from the limitations of vanilla web development, Django offers a comprehensive and robust toolkit that may just turn you into a web development superhero. With its built-in features and time-saving principles, Django allows you to build complex web applications without losing your sanity.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it: the joys and benefits of Django, demystified.

You see, I’m a beginner. Yes, I’m one of those people who can spend hours scratching my head over why my code is throwing an error, only to discover it’s because of that extra space. Ah, the power of indentation in Python!\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nFrom \"Print\" to Perplexity\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nLike many others, my journey began with the reassuring print(\"Hello, World!\"). The simplicity of Python syntax made me feel like a genius right away. But then I moved on to loops, lists, dictionaries, and suddenly I felt like I was reading ancient runes.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nStack Overflow: My New Best Friend\r\n</b></p><p>I never thought I’d spend my weekends scrolling through forums, but Stack Overflow has become my invaluable guide, my go-to place for answers. Being a beginner Python developer without Stack Overflow is like trying to make a PB&amp;J without the J. The community is nothing short of amazing. Ask anything—how to convert a list to a string, how to deal with indents—and you'll get an answer. Probably a dozen. Plus, you'll also get to learn fifty ways NOT to do something. It's like a crash course in what to do and what not to do, all rolled into one.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nLibraries: So Many, So Little Time\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nPython boasts an abundance of libraries that promise to simplify your life. Want to scrape a website? Use BeautifulSoup. Need to manipulate some data? Pandas has got you covered. The problem? There’s a library for everything, and choosing which one to learn first is like being a kid in a candy store. Except this candy store also has quantum physics textbooks, and everyone expects you to read them.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nThe Debugging Drama\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nAh, debugging. I’ve lost count of the number of times I've screamed into the void because my code didn’t work. But, eventually, you find that missing semicolon or the misnamed variable.

But if you're gunning for long-term success in the software development world, technical prowess is only half the story. Let's talk about the often-overlooked set of skills that can make or break a developer's career: soft skills.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nCommunication: The Forgotten Programming Language\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nIn a field awash with jargon and complex problems, clear and effective communication is a must. Whether you're explaining a bug, discussing architecture, or even arguing against a specific approach, the way you convey your thoughts is crucial. Remember, the best solution is meaningless if you can't explain why it's the best.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nTeamwork: Pair Programming with Humans\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nYou may be a rock star at solo projects, but software development is often a team sport. Learning to collaborate effectively—whether that's dividing tasks, reviewing each other's code, or brainstorming solutions—is a skill you can't afford to ignore.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nAdaptability: Staying Relevant in a Changing Landscape\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nNew frameworks, languages, and tools are the norm in this ever-evolving industry. Being adaptable is about more than just keeping up with the latest tech stack. It means having a willingness to change your point of view and adapt your established ways of doing things when presented with new information or perspectives.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nProblem-Solving: The Heart of Programming\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nSure, problem-solving might seem like a 'hard' skill. But the ability to break down complex issues into manageable parts, consider various approaches, and choose the most effective one isn't just about technical know-how. It's a mindset that requires creativity and critical thinking.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nEmpathy: Understanding Users and Colleagues\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nSoftware is built for people, by people. Empathy allows you to put yourself in the shoes of the user, which in turn helps you create more intuitive, user-friendly products. It's also important in the workplace, where understanding the viewpoints and challenges of your colleagues can improve collaboration and reduce conflict.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nLearning: The Never-Ending Journey\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nThe most successful software developers are perpetual learners. Whether it's a new programming language, a work-related soft skill, or some obscure yet fascinating aspect of computer science, the desire to continually grow and improve sets apart the good from the great.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nConclusion: Soft Skills, Hard Impact\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nIn an industry that often seems dominated by logic and rationality, these softer qualities might seem secondary, but they can make all the difference in your career. From communicating effectively and working well in a team to being adaptable and empathetic, soft skills are not just nice-to-haves—they're essential.

This hurdle often feels like the boss battle at the end of a particularly tricky video game, but fear not! Armed with the right strategies and tips, you can conquer any challenge that comes your way. Let's gear up.</p><p><b>\r\n\r\nThe Algorithm Gauntlet: Preparation is Key\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nThe first thing to understand about coding interviews is that they're not just about testing your programming knowledge. They also assess your problem-solving abilities. Start by reviewing common data structures like arrays, linked lists, and trees, as well as algorithms like sorting and searching. Knowing these like the back of your hand can give you a leg up.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nPractice Makes Perfect: Use Online Resources\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nUtilize platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Codewars to practice coding challenges. Time yourself to simulate real interview conditions and work on optimizing your solutions. The more problems you solve, the more comfortable you'll get with various types of questions.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nWhiteboard Wonders: Why Pen and Paper Matter\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nMany companies still favour whiteboard interviews. Even if your interview is virtual, practising on paper can help you think through problems without the crutch of auto-completion or syntax highlighting. This will make you a stronger problem solver and show your interviewers that you understand the logic behind the code.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nBehavioral Questions: Don’t Underestimate Soft Skills\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nYou may be a coding wizard, but if you can't play well with others, that could be a deal-breaker. Prepare for questions that probe your teamwork, conflict resolution, and communication skills. Use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result) to structure your answers.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nTest-Driven Development: The Unsung Hero\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nWriting tests for your code during an interview may seem like a waste of precious time. However, it can actually demonstrate foresight, attention to detail, and professionalism. If the interview platform allows it, include some basic tests to show you care about quality, not just functionality.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nDebugging: The Fine Art of Troubleshooting\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nInevitably, you're likely to hit some snags during your coding exercise. How you handle these is as important as the solution itself. Don't panic. Clearly articulate what you think the issue is, troubleshoot logically, and don’t be afraid to ask questions if you're stuck.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nThe Follow-Up: Seal the Deal\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nAfter the interview, send a polite thank-you email. This not only shows good manners but also gives you a chance to reiterate your enthusiasm for the role and the company. You can also clarify any points you think you might have fumbled during the interview.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nConclusion: Level Up Your Interview Skills\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nCoding interviews are a rite of passage in the software development world. But like any challenge, they become less daunting the more you understand what you're up against.

This post will explore the most popular methodologies in the software development world: Agile, Scrum, Waterfall, and more.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nAgile: The Flexible Framework\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nAgile is less a methodology and more a philosophy centered around iterative development and collaboration. Its core principle is flexibility—adapting to changes rather than sticking rigidly to a set plan. Agile is best suited for projects where requirements might evolve, and it encourages frequent client or stakeholder interaction.</p><p>\r\n\r\nKey Features of Agile:\r\n</p><ul><li>Iterative development cycles\r\n</li><li>Cross-functional teams\r\n</li><li>Emphasis on customer collaboration\r\n</li></ul><p><b>\r\nScrum: A Flavor of Agile\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nScrum is a specific Agile framework that focuses on short, time-boxed development cycles known as \"sprints,\" typically lasting two weeks. Scrum roles include the Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team, each with specific responsibilities.\r\n</p><p>\r\nKey Features of Scrum:\r\n</p><ul><li>Sprint planning and reviews\r\n</li><li>Daily stand-ups\r\n</li><li>Defined roles and ceremonies\r\n</li></ul><p><b>\r\nWaterfall: The Linear Approach\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nWaterfall is the antithesis of Agile, taking a sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next. This methodology is best for projects with well-defined requirements that are unlikely to change.\r\n</p><p>\r\nKey Features of Waterfall:\r\n</p><ul><li>Sequential phases\r\n</li><li>Detailed documentation\r\n</li><li>Limited customer involvement\r\n</li></ul><p><b>\r\nKanban: The Continuous Flow\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nKanban focuses on visualizing the workflow and limiting work-in-progress to improve efficiency. Unlike Scrum, there are no time-boxed sprints—work flows continuously through the Kanban board.\r\n</p><p>\r\nKey Features of Kanban:\r\n</p><ul><li>Visual task boards\r\n</li><li>WIP limits\r\n</li><li>Continuous delivery\r\n</li></ul><p><b>\r\nHybrid Models: Best of Both Worlds?\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nThere are hybrid models like Scrumban or Water-Scrum-Fall that attempt to combine elements from different methodologies.

Let's dive into how to Google like a pro.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nKeyword Crafting: The Right Phrase Makes All the Difference\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nSearch engines are all about keywords, but throwing in technical jargon haphazardly won't always yield the best results. Use specific keywords, and if the first search doesn’t yield useful results, try synonyms or related terms. For example, if you're looking for a Python function to remove duplicates from a list, you could try \"Python function remove duplicates list\" or \"Python unique items in list.\"\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nOperators: Your Hidden Arsenal\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nMost developers are unaware of the power of search operators. </p><ul><li>Use quotes for exact match searches like \"Cannot read property 'undefined' of null\". </li><li>Use the minus symbol to exclude words: JavaScript array methods -splice.\r\n</li></ul><p><b>\r\nSite-Specific Searches: Digging Deeper\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nWhen you know which websites often have the answers you seek, use site-specific searches. For example, to look for array-related questions on Stack Overflow, you could use array site:stackoverflow.com in your search query.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nAdvanced Search Features: The Extra Mile\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nGoogle offers an Advanced Search page that lets you fine-tune your searches by various criteria, including language, file type, and date range. This can be especially useful when you're looking for recent solutions to a problem related to a newly released library or tool.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nDon't Forget the Docs: Official Documentation as a Resource\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nWhile community forums and blogs are valuable resources, don't overlook the official documentation. Often, the most accurate and up-to-date information is found in the docs. You can usually get there quickly by adding docs to your search query, like React useState docs.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nCommunity Wisdom: Leverage Social Media and Forums\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nSometimes the information you seek is best found through community wisdom.

The internet is awash with forums, communities, and resources to help you find a solution. But have you noticed that some questions get prompt, detailed answers while others languish unanswered? The difference often comes down to how the question is asked. Let's delve into the art of posing queries that get you from SOS to SOLVED.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nThe Importance of a Good Title: Catch Their Eye\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nA good title is the first step in attracting the right attention. Keep it concise but descriptive. Instead of saying \"Help with Python function,\" opt for a more specific title like \"Python: How to iterate through a list and apply a function.\"\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nBe Specific but Not Overwhelming: Detail is Your Friend\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nThe devil is in the details, they say, and this is especially true when you're stuck on a coding issue. Provide enough information to frame the problem clearly but avoid overwhelming your potential helpers with irrelevant details. Share only the code that's directly related to the issue and trim out the rest.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nShow What You've Tried: Your Effort Counts\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nNothing elicits more eye-rolls than a question that shows zero effort on your part. Explain what you've attempted so far and what the outcomes were. This not only demonstrates your commitment to solving the problem but also helps others to rule out potential solutions you've already tried.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nFormatting: Make it Easy on the Eyes\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nCode is easier to understand when it's well-formatted. Use proper indentation, and take advantage of markdown or code blocks when posting on forums like Stack Overflow or Reddit. This makes it more likely that someone will take the time to understand your issue and provide a solution.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nAsk for Clarification, Not Just Solutions: Learning Over Spoon-feeding\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nWhile it's tempting to just ask for a quick fix, you'll benefit more in the long run by understanding the \"why\" and the \"how\" behind the solution. Encourage responders to explain their reasoning, or ask follow-up questions to get to the root of the issue.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nBe Courteous and Thankful: Manners Cost Nothing\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nRemember, people helping you online are often doing so out of kindness. A little courtesy goes a long way. Always thank those who take the time to respond, and if possible, post a follow-up to let everyone know which solution worked for you. It might help someone else in the future.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nConclusion: The Skill of Asking\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nAsking good questions is an underrated skill in software development. By crafting clear, detailed, and respectful queries, you not only increase your chances of finding a solution but also contribute to the community by making it easier for others to help you.

However, they're also often the biggest culprits when it comes to slow load times. As developers, it's our job to find the sweet spot between image quality and file size. Welcome to the world of image optimization for the web.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nUnderstanding Image Formats: JPEG, PNG, SVG, Oh My!\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nThe first step in optimizing images is choosing the right format. JPEGs are great for photos due to their lossy compression, which reduces file size. PNGs are ideal for graphics with fewer colors and offer lossless compression. SVGs are perfect for logos and icons and are resolution-independent.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nResolution and Dimensions: Size Does Matter\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nHigher resolution doesn't always mean better, especially on the web. Optimize your images by resizing them based on where they'll be displayed. Using CSS or HTML to resize a large image is akin to putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound; it doesn't solve the underlying problem.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nCompression Tools: Squeeze Those Byte</b>s\r\n</p><p>\r\nTools like ImageMagick, TinyPNG, and JPEG-Optimizer can compress your images without a noticeable loss of quality. If you're using a build process, consider adding image optimization tasks using plugins for Gulp, Webpack, or other build tools.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nLazy Loading: Images on Demand\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nLazy loading images can also improve website performance. This technique only loads images when they're about to be displayed on the user's viewport, rather than loading all images when the page is loaded.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nAdaptive Images: One Size Doesn't Fit All\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nWith the range of devices and screen sizes today, serving the same image to everyone is inefficient. Adaptive images adjust according to the user's device, often through the use of media queries or JavaScript.\r\n</p><p><b>\r\nCSS Image Sprites: A Single Image to Rule Them All\r\n</b></p><p>\r\nFor small images like icons and buttons, consider using CSS image sprites.

Fusing together elements from many genres to form a triumvirate of uncompromising alternative rock.</div><div><br></div><div>From the outset they aimed to create exciting, emphatic, absorbing music. Drawing on and harnessing elements of alternative rock, punk, and psychedelia, and with personal influences as varied as New Model Army, Nick Cave and The Pink Fairies, the trio meld styles to make something that is exciting, exhilarating, compelling, vital, and entirely their own. Fast and jagged, slow and smooth, serene and thunderous, Broken Lines take listeners and audiences on a glorious sonic journey, fuelled by genuine passion and propelled by towering musicianship and craft.</div><div><br></div><div>Not afraid to speak out on issues that concern them, the band projects a \"no compromise\" view of the world, delivering the sound of a band backed into a corner and trying desperately not to bite. With their own practice facility and recording suite, Broken Lines have the space and scope to fully commit to conceiving, creating, and recording, as well as honing their prodigious live performance skills. A Broken Lines show is a solid guarantee of an experience not to be forgotten.</div><div><br></div><div>The debut album 'Liberation' announced Broken Lines in October 2019 and gave flight to 10 stunning self-penned tracks. With the second album well under way and catchy, hard hitting single releases, Broken Lines deserve to be heard by the widest audience.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>Mark Briscoe - Bass Guitar, Samplers, Backing Vocals</b></div><div><br></div><div>I've been involved with music since I was a kid, it has been the one true constant in my life. People come and go but I've always had a bass, it is very special to me.</div><div><br></div><div>For the most part I have played bass guitar, which is my instrument of choice, but I am also accomplished with guitars and keyboards and will have a crack at anything. I have a solid interest in the technical side of music from engineering to sound production and have a studio setup where I record my projects.</div><div><br></div><div>I've got diverse taste in music and, having grown up with punk, retain the same attitude and outlook that I had as a teenager, along with a wide-ranging appreciation of most music!</div><div><br></div><div>At school I started a band with my (still) best mate Mick. We were right in the middle of the punk explosion and everyone was forming bands, so we thought we'd have a go. Like a lot of bassists, I started with the bass because I couldn't play anything! Mick had a little knowledge of music, so we stumbled on in his garage playing Clash songs and writing our own stuff. I was hugely influenced by JJ Burnel of The Stranglers, I never knew the bass could be played like that, so I set about learning all his bass parts. To This day his style can be heard in my playing.</div><div><br></div><div>At 19 I played bass with The Varukers, co-writing the seminal album \"Another Religion Another War\", which to this day is a very popular UK82/D-Beat favourite.</div><div><br></div><div>After the Varukers I put Fuse together with a couple of mates and we headed off to Brighton to seek our fortune. Once there I found employment in a rehearsal/pre-production studio and had the privilege of working with some great bands including Primal Scream, Felt and The Levellers.</div><div><br></div><div>We also managed to get ourselves on a nationwide tour with Transvision Vamp. It was a great introduction to \"big time\" touring but was also a very clinical operation. While we were on tour we played in Bradford and struck up a friendship with Rob and Moose from New Model Army, one of my all-time fave bands! After they saw us play they invited us to tour with them the following February.</div><div><br></div><div>The New Model army tour for their landmark album \"Thunder &amp; Consolation\" was one of my greatest experiences. Playing to thousands of people who gave us massive support and friendship, not to mention playing on a stage with a monitoring system designed specifically for a loud bass player!</div><div><br></div><div>When touring with New Model Army, Sounds hailed me as \"the best bass this side of World Domination Enterprises\", high praise indeed! 20 years later I was also one of the few bassists given the opportunity to audition for New Model Army in 2013 as a replacement for their bassist, an excellent experience and somewhat of a highlight for me!</div><div><br></div><div>We then moved to London and ended up as part of the squat scene down there. We changed our name to \"Tribal Energy\" and soon established ourselves as a force to be reckoned with. Putting on alternative rave nights, in partnership with indie circus acts and artists, our crowning glory was putting on the, now infamous, \"Squatters Ball\", where we invited The Levellers up from Brighton to join us for a great night. Fuse split after 12 years, having felt the band had run its course.</div><div><br></div><div>My next project was with a band from Cardiff called SlingShot. The guitarist, Simon (Daffy), was from \"The Icons of Filth\", another legendary hardcore punk band back in the day, so we had a lot in common.</div><div><br></div><div>It was with this band that I found a life-long musical partner in the shape of Christine, the singer in the band. We recorded an album entitled \"Animal Farm\" and released it via Wolf Entertainment, who have now also signed Broken--Lines. Once that was done the band drifted apart mostly because of distance between the members.</div><div><br></div><div>Christine and I formed a writing partnership called Violet Wylde. Christine has the most extraordinary voice that never ceases to amaze me. I write and record all the music and she puts the most exciting vocals together, always something I am never prepared for, and always perfect for the music. We get together roughly once a year to add to our catalog but again, distance, and other band commitments, make it difficult to do much more. We are musical soul mates and that is fine by me!</div><div><br></div><div>I did an online band project with members from Internal Autonomy, calling ourselves Feroxide. We released a few albums to great critical acclaim. As an online project it was a really good achievement!</div><div><br></div><div>Finally, I spotted a couple of wily looking characters looking for a bassist on FaceBook. As they were relatively close, and the music was to my taste, I messaged them. Jack and Dave came over with cake! It was shockingly obvious that there was a massive fraternal bond to be had, even before playing together, so we agreed to give it a go and, as they say, the rest is history (well... documented elsewhere on the site!).</div><div><br></div><div>Nowadays Jack and Dave are like brothers to me and things just keep getting better and better!</div><div>So, 40 odd years on since I first picked up a bass (thanks Nige) I still have the same love for my instrument and intend to grow old extremely disgracefully!</div><div>I am loud, proud and slightly round!</div><div><br></div><div>For those interested my gear is:</div><div>Fender American Standard Precision Bass - Black Fender American Standard Precision Bass - Olympic White Fender American Standard Jazz Bass - Olympic White</div><div><br></div><div>My amplification: Ashdown Engineering ABM EVOII 900 Head into 4 x 10 and 1 x 15 ABM cabinets. Ashdown Engineering RM-800-EVO 800w Rootmaster Head into a RM-610T-EVO 900w 6 x 10 cabinet.</div><div><br></div><div>I am very proud to be a listed Ashdown Artist and considers them to be the best bass amplifiers bar none.</div><div><br></div><div>Hare Krishna... Mark</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>JACK JACKSON - Drums, Keyboards, Backing Vocals</b></div><div><br></div><div>I started off small, while thinking big, at the outset of my musical career. The main requirement that came with playing the triangle in a school brass band was the ability to count the exact amount of bars before a) it needed hitting, or b) you fell asleep. Whichever came first. This could sometimes be just once in a two-hour concert!!! I’d had my eye on the snare drum for some years but was no match, at 12 years old, for the predatorial six former who guarded and played it on every occasion. I gave up the brass band and joined the orchestra where I got to play ‘second’, and then ‘first’, violin within a far more egalitarian environment.</div><div><br></div><div>My big break came a couple of years later at 15 years old when a friend’s Hungarian mother, Mrs Domonkos, offered me a loan of £50 in order to buy a drum kit so that I could play in a band with her bass-playing son, Paul! I accepted the offer and along with Des on guitar/vocals we formed a covers band, The Shy Tots... Geddit?</div><div><br></div><div>I left soon after having met some like-minded kids at school who were into both the newly emerging punk scene and writing their own songs.</div><div><br></div><div>At 15, in 1975, I became the drummer for The VIce Squad. We bought a clapped-out old green Ford Transit van and went on to play gigs all over the North of England supporting such bands as Adam and the Ants (I got to use the drummer’s drum kit) and Sham 69 (they wouldn’t share the dressing room so we had to change in the toilet). It was then that I also discovered that my nameless, but beautiful-sounding drum kit, bought with the loan, wasn’t actually a disgustingly tacky, wood-finished-crappy-vinyl-covered skiffle kit, but a beautiful off-white Premier kit! Ahhhhhhhhh! Somebody had spent a lot of time covering it!? More to the point, I’d discovered that I had an affinity with my drums and no regrets about leaving the brass band. Two albums later The Vice Squad disbanded and I went to art college to study Graphic Design, having re-sat my A-Levels.</div><div><br></div><div>I’ve played with an eclectic mix of musicians from cabaret-type-working-mens-club turns through to sultry late-night Covent Garden wine bar jazz ensembles. Not forgetting the three-piece Dolly Parton send-up skiffle band I performed with at many of the Vic Reeves comedy nights down at Goldsmiths Tavern, in London. Forever gleening and learning and eventually culminating in the band I now play with.</div><div><br></div><div>In 2008 I had a brief spell drumming with a band that Dave had just formed, Bikini Red, but it was early days for them and I was drawn to the brighter and more established lights of the Punk-Surf-Indie band, The Ray Guns, who were in need of a new drummer. The music was some of the best I’ve ever played and totally fitted my style. However, after two successful albums, storm clouds began to form and I was pushed into leaving by the junior-school-playground approach of the ‘management’ i.e. the guitarist/songwriter’s missus. I quit.</div><div><br></div><div>In 2012-14 I had a fantastic time drumming and touring the UK, Europe and Finland, thanks Harry! with psychedelic space gods, Sendelica, before joining my present band, Broken Lines.</div><div><br></div><div>It just keeps getting better.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><b>DAVID WELLAN - Guitar, Vocals, Modular</b></div><div><br></div><div>I’ve always had an interest and a simmering passion for music, especially guitar and synth based stuff. I didn’t start playing guitar until my early twenties, trying to get my head around the basic chords whilst listening to guitarists like David Gilmour, John Lee Hooker and Hendrix and wondering why I was bothering!</div><div><br></div><div>My first true collaborative experience came in 2001 when I worked with a good friend of mine and amazing sound artist, David Handford. He introduced me to the world of synths and completely opened my mind to where you can go with sound, I am eternally grateful to him for opening my ears and guiding me to a totally different sonic world. He also gave me the confidence to go for it as I realised that I could do anything with sound and my journey really began.</div><div><br></div><div>My first band experience was with a group of good friends in 2002, we played a selection of our favourite, mainly blues inspired covers. It was great fun and I worked with a good friend of mine Kev Griffiths who guided and inspired me with my guitar playing. This was my first introduction to Jack Jackson on drums. We played at a few friend’s parties and had lots of fun, but it also seemed to be the catalyst for pretty much every member of the band to split with their partners!! We disbanded!.</div><div><br></div><div>My next band project was with Bikini Red in 2008. I had decided by this point that I only wanted to write my own material and develop my own songs. The band was formed with some good friends; Alex Bray, Jake Hollyfield, Peter Kinsey and initially, Jack on drums. Jack was then offered the opportunity to play with a great local band; The Ray Guns and he went for it. Jack was replace by a great local drummer, Joe Turner. We had a lot of fun writing our own music, I’d come up with the words and the basic structure and then we’d all work on making it sound like a proper song. We played a few local gigs and I learned a great deal from the experience. After our biggest and best gig in Tenby we realised that we now had different ideas on where to go next and with some of the band looking to moving away, we decided to call it a day.</div><div><br></div><div>I continued to work on and write new material and decided it would be fun to start jamming with a good friend of mine, Ed Edmonds. We got together in 2013 and made lots of noise with distorted guitars, like two crazy teenagers, it was great! He would come up with lyrics and I would improvise a tune and we were creating stuff at an impressive rate…so we decided we should try and get something more solid together. I got my friend Alex Bray (from Bikini Red) to play bass and Ed found a local drummer, Misha Burnham to come and play with us. The first session was awesome, if not a little cramped in our garden shed and we decided to go for it and found a space to practice and at a local brewery! The beginnings of Broken--Lines was formed. Over a period of about 12 months and after a number of personnel changes, Broken Lines had a set of solid songs and a committed band was formed, comprising myself, Peter Brierton on Bass and Misha on drums. We decided to practice at Misha’s house, which was fun as his place is totally off-grid! We had 3 years of great fun, creativity and a number of very successful local gigs.</div><div><br></div><div>In 2017, Jack became available to play with us and he joined the band on keyboards / synth. His contribution to the band was immense and we had a number of very inspiring practice sessions and gigs. At this point I felt I really wanted to push the Broken--Lines further and took the bold step of taking a time-out as I needed time to consider how to move forward and what I wanted to do. I decided to part company with Pete and Misha, whilst Jack and I started looking for a new bass player. After a couple of initial possibilities we were contacted by Mark Briscoe at the end of 2017. His experience, ability and musical knowledge have taken Broken Lines to whole new and exciting level…</div>"}}]
